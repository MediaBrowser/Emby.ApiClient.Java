Emby.ApiClient.Java
===========================

This library allows Android clients to easily access the Emby API. It is built with Volley, OkHttp, Boon and Robolectric. The dependencies are modular and can easily be swapped out with alternate implementations, if needed.

# Single Server Example #

This is an example of connecting to a single server using a fixed, predictable address, from an app that has user-specific features (and requires a user login).


``` java

        // Developers should create their own logger implementation
        logger = new NullLogger();

        // The underlying http stack. Developers can inject their own if desired
        IAsyncHttpClient httpClient = new VolleyHttpClient(logger, getApplicationContext());

		// Android developers should use GsonJsonSerializer
		IJsonSerializer jsonSerializer = new BoonJsonSerializer();

		// Android developers should use AndroidDevice
		IDevice device = new Device("deviceId", "deviceName");

		ApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient(httpClient, jsonSerializer, logger, "http://localhost:8096", "My app name", "app version 123", device, new ApiEventListener());

		apiClient.AuthenticateUserAsync("username", "password", new Response<AuthenticationResult>(){

            @Override
            public void onResponse(AuthenticationResult result) {
                // Authentication succeeded
            }

            @Override
            public void onError() {
                // Authentication failed
            }
            
        });

```

The **ServerLocator** class can be used to discover servers on the local network, although it is recommended to handle that via a **ConnectionManager**, discussed later on in this document.


# Service Apps #

If your app is some kind of service or utility (e.g. Sickbeard), you should construct ApiClient with your user-supplied api key.

``` java

        // Developers should create their own logger implementation
        logger = new NullLogger();

        // The underlying http stack. Developers can inject their own if desired
        IAsyncHttpClient httpClient = new VolleyHttpClient(logger, getApplicationContext());

		// Android developers should use GsonJsonSerializer
		IJsonSerializer jsonSerializer = new BoonJsonSerializer();

		// Services should just authenticate using their api key
        ApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient(httpClient, jsonSerializer, logger, "http://localhost:8096", "My api key", new ApiEventListener());

```


# Web Socket #

Once you have an ApiClient instance, you can easily connect to the server's web socket using:

``` java

            ApiClient.OpenWebSocket();
```

This will open a connection in a background thread, and periodically check to ensure it's still connected. The web socket provides various events that can be used to receive notifications from the server. Simply override the methods in ApiEventListener:


``` java

			@Override
            public void onSetVolumeCommand(int value)
    		{
    		}
```

# Multi-Server Usage #


The above examples are designed for cases when your app always connects to a single server, and you always know the address. If your app is designed to support multiple networks and/or multiple servers, then **IConnectionManager** should be used in place of the above example.

IConnectionManager features:

- Supports connection to multiple servers
- Automatic local server discovery
- Wake on Lan
- Automatic LAN to WAN failover


``` c#

            // Android developer should use AndroidCredentialProvider
			ICredentialProvider credentialProvider = new CredentialProvider();

			INetworkConnection networkConnection = new NetworkConnection(logger);

            // Android developers should use GsonJsonSerializer
			IJsonSerializer jsonSerializer = new BoonJsonSerializer();
	
			// Developers are encouraged to create their own ILogger implementation
			ILogger logger = new NullLogger();

			IServerLocator serverLocator = new ServerLocator(logger);

            // The underlying http stack. Developers can inject their own if desired
        	IAsyncHttpClient httpClient = new VolleyHttpClient(logger, getApplicationContext());

			// Android developers should use AndroidDevice
			IDevice device = new Device("deviceId", "deviceName");
	
			// This describes the device capabilities
			ClientCapabilities capabilities = new ClientCapabilities();

			ApiEventListener eventListener = new ApiEventListener();

			// Android developers should use AndroidConnectionManager
			IConnectionManager connectionManager = new ConnectionManager(credentialProvider,
                networkConnection,
                logger,
                serverLocator,
                httpClient,
				"My app name"
                "1.0.0.0",
                device,
                capabilities,
                eventListener);
          
```

# Multi-Server Startup Workflow #

After you've created your instance of IConnectionManager, simply call the Connect method. It will return a result object with three properties:

- State
- ServerInfo
- ApiClient

ServerInfo and ApiClient will be null if State == Unavailable. Let's look at an example.


``` java

         connectionManager.Connect(new Response<ConnectionResult>(){

            @Override
            public void onResponse(ConnectionResult result) {

				switch (result.getState())
				{
					case ConnectionState.ConnectSignIn:
						// Connect sign in screen should be presented
						// Authenticate using LoginToConnect, then call Connect again to start over
	
					case ConnectionState.ServerSignIn:
						// A server was found and the user needs to login.
						// Display a login screen and authenticate with the server using result.ApiClient
	
					case ConnectionState.ServerSelection:
						// Multiple servers available
						// Display a selection screen by calling GetAvailableServers
						// When a server is chosen, call the Connect overload that accept either a ServerInfo object or a String url.
	
					case ConnectionState.SignedIn:
						// A server was found and the user has been signed in using previously saved credentials.
						// Ready to browse using result.ApiClient
				}

            }

        });


```

When the user wishes to logout of the individual server, simply call apiClient.Logout as normal.

If the user wishes to connect to a new server, simply use the Connect overload that accepts an address. 


``` java

		 String address = "http://192.168.1.174:8096";

         connectionManager.Connect(address, new Response<ConnectionResult>(){

            @Override
            public void onResponse(ConnectionResult result) {

				switch (result.State)
				{
					case ConnectionState.Unavailable:
						// Server unreachable
	
					case ConnectionState.ServerSignIn:
						// A server was found and the user needs to login.
						// Display a login screen and authenticate with the server using result.ApiClient
	
					case ConnectionState.SignedIn:
						// A server was found and the user has been signed in using previously saved credentials.
						// Ready to browse using result.ApiClient
				}

            }

        });

			

```

If at anytime the RemoteLoggedOut event is fired, simply start the workflow all over again by calling connectionManager.Connect().

ConnectionManager will handle opening and closing web socket connections at the appropiate times. All your app needs to do is use an ApiClient instance to subscribe to individual events.


``` java

			@Override
            public void onSetVolumeCommand(int value)
    		{
    		}

```

With multi-server connectivity it is not recommended to keep a global ApiClient instance, or pass an ApiClient around the application. Instead keep a factory that will resolve the appropriate ApiClient instance depending on context. In order to help with this, ConnectionManager has a GetApiClient method that accepts a BaseItemDto and returns an ApiClient from the server it belongs to.


# Android Usage #

Android is fully supported, and special subclasses are provided for it:

- AndroidConnectionManager
- AndroidApiClient

AndroidApiClient includes a getImageLoader() method that will return a Volley ImageLoader.

At minimum, this library requires the following permissions declared in AndroidManifest.xml:

- INTERNET
- ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
- READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE


# Android Syncing #

This library includes all code needed for automatic camera image uploading, and mobile sync. All that's needed for Android apps is wiring up the service. 

### authenticator.xml ###

This file is required within res/xml. A sample can be found [here](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.ApiClient.Java/blob/master/android/samples/authenticator.xml "here"), and it can be used by most apps without any modification.

### syncadapter.xml ###

This file is required within res/xml. A sample can be found [here](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.ApiClient.Java/blob/master/android/samples/syncadapter.xml "here"), and it can be used by most apps without any modification.

### AndroidManifest.xml ###

Syncing requires additional permissions to be declared:

- READ_SYNC_STATS
- WRITE_SYNC_SETTINGS
- AUTHENTICATE_ACCOUNTS

In addition, it requires three xml nodes to declare sync-related services. These are a provider node, and two service nodes. A sample can be found [here](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.ApiClient.Java/blob/master/android/samples/AndroidManifest.xml "here"). Most applications should generally be able to use it without modification.

Finally, when the application starts, start a periodic background sync.


> new PeriodicSync(context).Run();

This will trigger a periodic sync that will run on a schedule, and will be managed by the system sync manager. It will take into consideration various factors such as battery level, network connection, etc.

For testing purposes, an immediate sync can be requested via:

> new OnDemandSync(context).Run();
